Introduction
============

This is the online documentation for the reference implementation of the eTOX prediction webservice API v3.

More information about the eTOX project can be found here: http://www.etoxproject.eu/

The source code of this reference implementation is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/mnkleinoeder/etoxws-api.

This documentation provides four major parts:

* the actual specification of the REST API, i.e., URLs and schemas of the exchange data structures
* the documentation of the Python reference implementation and how to write an adapter to perform the actual predictions
* the documentation how to install the reference implementation on CentOS 6 or Ubuntu 12/14
* a guide for executing the code in development mode

This project has been developed in close collaboration with the eTOXlab development: https://github.com/manuelpastor/eTOXlab
