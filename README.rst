eTOX Prediction webservice API
==============================

About the eTOX project
----------------------

   The eTOX project aims to develop a drug safety database from the pharmaceutical industry legacy toxicology reports > and public toxicology data; innovative in silico strategies and novel software tools to better predict the
   toxicological profiles of small molecules in early stages of the drug development pipeline

About this Github project
-------------------------

Molecular Networks develops the eTOXsys software system as integration platform for the software modules developed within the eTOX project. The system is based on a distributed webservice architecture.

A central part of the system are prediction modules developed and provided by different partners. The integration of these prediction modules requires a webservice API for the communication of these modules with the eTOXsys platform.

This Github project provides the specification, documentation and a reference implementation of the eTOX prediction webservice API.

The documentation is available at https://etoxsys.eu/etoxwsapi/doc/.
